STATEMENTS(unaudited)Note 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURESUnaudited Interim Financial InformationWe have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2023 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Prior Period ReclassificationsCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Other operating expense (income), net” was reclassified into “Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and capitalized content costs, operating lease assets, and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded approximately $500 million of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in “Technology and infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and administrative” on our consolidated statements of operations and included approximately $280 million recorded within our AWS segment.For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, we recorded approximately $350 million and $420 million of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores in 2022 and fulfillment network facilities and physical stores in 2023. These charges were recorded in “Other operating expense (income), net” on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our North America segment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, we also recorded expenses of approximately $300 million and $200 million primarily in “Fulfillment” in 2022 and “Cost of sales” and “Fulfillment” in 2023, on our consolidated statements of operations primarily relating to terminating contracts for certain leases not yet commenced as well as other purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North America segment.7Table of ContentsSupplemental Cash Flow InformationThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions):Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,Twelve Months EndedSeptember 30,202220232022202320222023SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION:Cash paid for interest on debt, net of capitalized interest$304 $465 $932 $1,821 $1,299 $2,450 Cash paid for operating leases1,813 2,692 6,268 7,687 7,961 10,052 Cash paid for interest on finance leases88 76 290 234 404 318 Cash paid for interest on financing obligations39 50 152 150 189 205 Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds742 2,628 4,340 6,982 4,674 8,677 Assets acquired under operating leases6,755 3,345 14,031 11,075 19,839 15,844 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications131 183 358 431 1,966 748 Property and equipment recognized during the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements526 93 2,877 308 4,847 618 Property and equipment derecognized after the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements, with the associated leases recognized as operating2,195 492 3,307 1,212 3,363 3,063 Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2022202320222023Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share10,191 10,322 10,178 10,286 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards140 236 — 166 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share10,331 10,558 10,178 10,452 Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions):Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2022202320222023Marketable equity securities valuation gains (losses)$1,039 $1,196 $(11,528)$1,015 Equity warrant valuation gains (losses)(170)(27)(1,606)(188)Upward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies11 7 76 33 Foreign currency gains (losses)(103)(94)(206)(15)Other, net(18)(51)(92)(196)Total other income (expense), net759 1,031 (13,356)649 Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $(10.4) billion and $926 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (“Rivian”). Our investment in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian’s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2023, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 17% ownership interest, and an approximate 15% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles, and one of our employees serving on 8Table of ContentsRivian’s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $2.9 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. The investment was subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022.Required summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in millions):Six Months Ended June 30,20222023Revenues$459 $1,782 Gross profit(1,206)(947)Loss from operations(3,287)(2,718)Net loss(3,305)(2,544)InventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.Accounts Receivable, Net and OtherIncluded in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers, as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, customer receivables, net, were $26.6 billion and $28.1 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $6.9 billion and $6.3 billion, seller receivables, net, were $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, and other receivables, net, were $3.1 billion and $2.5 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $4.5 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.Digital Video and Music ContentThe total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 were $16.7 billion and $18.0 billion. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.6 years. Total video and music expense was $4.2 billion and $4.6 billion in Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $11.4 billion and $13.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023.Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $16.1 billion, of which $10.9 billion was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $133.0 billion as of September 30, 2023. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.5 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.9Table of ContentsAcquisition ActivityOn February 22, 2023, we acquired 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (“One Medical”), for cash consideration of approximately $3.5 billion, net of cash acquired, to provide health care options for customers. The acquired assets primarily consist of $1.3 billion of intangible assets and $2.5 billion of goodwill, which is allocated to our North America segment.Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the One Medical acquisition were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant.In August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation, as amended in July 2023, for approximately $1.7 billion, including its debt, subject to customary closing conditions. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash on hand.Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable SecuritiesAs of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:Level 1—Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2—Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level 3—Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.10Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions): December 31, 2022September 30, 2023  TotalEstimatedFair ValueCost orAmortizedCostGrossUnrealizedGainsGrossUnrealizedLossesTotalEstimatedFair ValueCash$10,666 $10,090 $— $— $10,090 Level 1 securities:Money market funds27,899 20,424 — — 20,424 Equity securities (1)3,709 4,684 Level 2 securities:Foreign government and agency securities535 28 — (1)27 U.S. government and agency securities2,146 3,322 — (128)3,194 Corporate debt securities22,627 24,542 — (287)24,255 Asset-backed securities2,572 1,892 — (84)1,808 Other debt securities237 169 — (6)163 $70,391 $60,467 $— $(506)$64,645 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2)(365)(476)Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities$70,026 $64,169 ___________________(1)The related unrealized gains (losses) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” were $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion in Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $(11.3) billion and $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023.(2)We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily as collateral for real estate, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as “Accounts receivable, net and other” and of twelve months or longer as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies.” The following table summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities as of September 30, 2023 (in millions):AmortizedCostEstimatedFair ValueDue within one year$43,198 $43,132 Due after one year through five years5,623 5,284 Due after five years through ten years453 429 Due after ten years1,103 1,026 Total$50,377 $49,871 Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have certain prepayment conditions.Non-Marketable InvestmentsWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, these warrants had a fair value of $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are classified as Level 2 and 3 assets.As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, equity investments not accounted for under the equity-method and without readily determinable fair values had a carrying value of $715 million and $753 million, with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.Additionally, in September 2023 we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note.

For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified.(3)Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction.(4)Excludes approximately $5.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any.13Table of ContentsOther ContingenciesWe are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits, and monitoring or evaluating potential claims, related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically relate to (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations.Legal ProceedingsThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the matters described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings” of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings” of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, as supplemented by the following:Beginning in June 2019 with Wilcosky v. Amazon.com, Inc., now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (“N.D. Ill.”), private litigants have filed a number of cases in U.S. federal and state courts, including Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. (N.D. Ill.), alleging, among other things, that Amazon’s collection, storage, use, retention, and protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The complaints allege purported classes of Illinois residents who had biometric identifiers collected through Amazon products or services, including Amazon Photos, Alexa, AWS cloud services, Ring, Amazon Connect, Amazon’s Flex driver app, and Amazon’s virtual try-on technology. The complaints seek certification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.Beginning in March 2020, with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (“W.D. Wash.”), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon’s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in September 2023 in the W.D. Wash. alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace services, and unlawfully maintains those monopolies through anticompetitive practices relating to our pricing policies, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks injunctive and structural relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and costs. Amazon’s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-Wilson in March 2022 and March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General’s lawsuit in March 2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon’s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon’s pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General’s lawsuit in its entirety; the dismissal is under appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the 14Table of Contentsamounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See also “Note 7 — Income Taxes.”Note 5 — DEBT As of September 30, 2023, we had $66.5 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (the “Notes”) and $972 million of borrowings under our credit facility.

The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 12.9 years as of September 30, 2023.Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $61.4 billion and $56.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates.In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the “Term Loan”), which matures in January 2024 and bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. If we exercise our option to extend the Term Loan’s maturity to January 2025, the interest rate spread will increase from 0.75% to 1.05%. As of September 30, 2023, $5.0 billion of the Term Loan was outstanding, which was included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had an interest rate of 6.2%.We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $1.0 billion and $972 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, which had an interest rate of 5.6% and 6.6%, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, we have pledged $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were $6.8 billion and $567 million of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest rate, including issuance costs, of 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.We have a $10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”), with a term that extends to March 2025. It may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The 15Table of Contentsinterest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.We have a $10.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Short-Term Credit Agreement”), which matures in November 2023 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.05% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023.We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $1.2 billion and $166 million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $7.8 billion of unused letters of credit as of September 30, 2023.  Note 6 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYStock Repurchase ActivityIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration, which replaced the previous $5.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in February 2016. We repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for $6.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 under these programs. There were no repurchases of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program.Stock Award ActivityCommon shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.6 billion and 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited.

The estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 was 26.5% and 26.3%.

Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.17Table of ContentsFor 2023, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the foreign income deduction and U.S. federal research and development credit and adversely affected by state income taxes. In addition, valuation gains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and may cause variability in our effective tax rate.Our income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.0 billion, which included $3.3 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $4.1 billion, which included $175 million of net discrete tax expense, primarily consisting of discrete tax expense related to shortfalls from stock-based compensation and approximately $600 million of tax benefit resulting from a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our 2022 U.S. federal R&D credit. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $742 million and $2.6 billion in Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, and $4.3 billion and $7.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023.As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, tax contingencies were approximately $4.0 billion and $5.0 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income. In September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (“LTA”) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this matter. We believe the LTA’s position is without merit, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect to recoup taxes paid.The Indian tax authority (“ITA”) has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will need to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe the ITA’s position is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously in the Indian courts, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission’s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Note 8 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are incurred in the U.S. and are included in our North America and AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are allocated to the AWS 18Table of Contentssegment based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments.
