of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q111. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 12, 2022. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023.Allowance for Credit Losses—Client Receivables and Contract Assets As of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $26,770 and $25,786, respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. InvestmentsAll available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values).Our non-current investments are as follows:May 31, 2023August 31, 2022Equity method investments$22,816 $164,164 Investments without readily determinable fair values153,443 153,808 Total non-current investments$176,259 $317,972 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net. As of August 31, 2022, our equity method investments consisted primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. On March 30, 2023, Duck Creek Technologies was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $19.00 per share. As part of this transaction, we received proceeds of $400,355 and recorded a gain of $252,920 in Other income (expense), net during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q12Depreciation and Amortization As of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, total accumulated depreciation was $2,766,344 and $2,490,187, respectively.

This consists of approximately $1.2 billion of employee severance and other personnel costs and $300 million of costs related to the consolidation of office space. The actual amount and timing of severance and other personnel costs are dependent in part upon local country consultation processes and regulations and may differ from our current expectations and estimates.Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q132. RevenuesDisaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $26 billion and $24 billion as of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 37% of our remaining performance obligations as of May 31, 2023 as revenue in fiscal 2023, an additional 35% in fiscal 2024, and the balance thereafter.Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $687,098 and $712,715 as of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $852,188 and $807,940 as of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of May 31, 2023As of August 31, 2022Receivables$11,005,863 $10,484,211 Contract assets (current)1,576,797 1,292,564 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current)12,582,660 11,776,775 Contract assets (non-current)66,432 46,844 Deferred revenues (current)5,101,692 4,478,048 Deferred revenues (non-current)687,098 712,715 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the nine months ended May 31, 2023 were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors.

Financial Instruments DerivativesIn the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $72,091 and $94,351 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023, respectively, and net losses of $31,285 and $67,812 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: May 31, 2023August 31, 2022AssetsCash Flow HedgesOther current assets$56,648 $89,867 Other non-current assets39,624 69,209 Other DerivativesOther current assets6,986 8,657 Total assets$103,258 $167,733 LiabilitiesCash Flow HedgesOther accrued liabilities$54,887 $61,156 Other non-current liabilities25,743 42,537 Other DerivativesOther accrued liabilities90,903 83,792 Total liabilities$171,533 $187,485 Total fair value$(68,275)$(19,752)Total notional value$13,373,535 $11,095,604 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: May 31, 2023August 31, 2022Net derivative assets$46,349 $140,073 Net derivative liabilities114,624 159,825 Total fair value$(68,275)$(19,752)Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q199. Income TaxesWe apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022 were 22.2% and 27.1%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2023 was primarily due to lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, the tax impact from an investment gain and higher benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022 were 22.1% and 23.8%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 was primarily due to lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, higher benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities and the tax impact from an investment gain, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based payments.10. Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $1,750,000 and $1,349,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $51,000 and $49,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. As of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $1,239,648 and $1,116,298, respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of May 31, 2023, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which we are appealing. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May 3, 2023. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q2011.
