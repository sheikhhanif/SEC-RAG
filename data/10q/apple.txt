Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.Earnings Per ShareThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):Three Months EndedNine Months EndedJuly 1,2023June 25,2022July 1,2023June 25,2022Numerator:Net income$19,881 $19,442 $74,039 $79,082 Denominator:Weighted-average basic shares outstanding15,697,614 16,162,945 15,792,497 16,277,824 Effect of dilutive securities77,407 99,258 66,766 117,113 Weighted-average diluted shares15,775,021 16,262,203 15,859,263 16,394,937 Basic earnings per share$1.27 $1.20 $4.69 $4.86 Diluted earnings per share$1.26 $1.20 $4.67 $4.82 Approximately 32 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended July 1, 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 6Note 2 – RevenueNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022 were as follows (in millions):Three Months EndedNine Months EndedJuly 1,2023June 25,2022July 1,2023June 25,2022iPhone®$39,669 $40,665 $156,778 $162,863 Mac®6,840 7,382 21,743 28,669 iPad®5,791 7,224 21,857 22,118 Wearables, Home and Accessories8,284 8,084 30,523 31,591 Services21,213 19,604 62,886 58,941 Total net sales$81,797 $82,959 $293,787 $304,182 Total net sales include $3.3 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended July 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of April 1, 2023, $3.1 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended June 25, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of March 26, 2022, $7.0 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended July 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $6.3 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended June 25, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.As of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively.

However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.Foreign Exchange RiskTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of July 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 8The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Interest Rate RiskTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):July 1,2023September 24,2022Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$45,425 $102,670 Interest rate contracts$19,375 $20,125 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$90,977 $185,381 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):September 24, 2022Fair Value ofDerivatives Designatedas Accounting HedgesFair Value ofDerivatives Not Designatedas Accounting HedgesTotalFair ValueDerivative assets (1):Foreign exchange contracts$4,317 $2,819 $7,136 Derivative liabilities (2):Foreign exchange contracts$2,205 $2,547 $4,752 Interest rate contracts$1,367 $— $1,367 (1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):July 1,2023September 24,2022Hedged assets/(liabilities):Current and non-current marketable securities$14,863 $13,378 Current and non-current term debt$(17,986)$(18,739)Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 9Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 44% of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of July 1, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 14%. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement DetailsThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):InventoriesJuly 1,2023September 24,2022Components$3,788 $1,637 Finished goods3,563 3,309 Total inventories$7,351 $4,946 Property, Plant and Equipment, NetJuly 1,2023September 24,2022Gross property, plant and equipment$114,337 $114,457 Accumulated depreciation and amortization(70,787)(72,340)Total property, plant and equipment, net$43,550 $42,117 Other Income/(Expense), NetThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022 (in millions):Three Months EndedNine Months EndedJuly 1,2023June 25,2022July 1,2023June 25,2022Interest and dividend income$980 $722 $2,766 $2,072 Interest expense(998)(719)(2,931)(2,104)Other expense, net(247)(13)(429)(65)Total other income/(expense), net$(265)$(10)$(594)$(97)Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 10Note 5 – Income TaxesEuropean Commission State Aid DecisionOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision.
